## Structure
The architectural blueprint for this app closely mirrors the **Atomic Design Pattern**.

![Alt text](/assets/structure.png)

- `Core Components`: Essential, reusable building blocks like buttons or text inputs.
- `Components`: Customized mix of core components, fused with specific logic.
- `Containers`: Predefined screen layouts. Here, components come together, shaped by page-specific logic (styles, animations...).
- `Pages`: Deploy containers, manage external logic like API communication (submit, get data...).
